This repository contains a **Jupyter Notebook** that demonstrates how to perform **Machine Learning** tasks using **PySpark**. It is designed to provide a hands-on, practical introduction to using the Spark MLlib library for scalable machine learning.

## 📚 Contents

- **Notebook**: 
  - `ML-pyspark.ipynb`: A sample Jupyter Notebook showcasing end-to-end machine learning workflows in PySpark.
  
- **Sample Dataset**: 
  - Includes a small dataset for demonstration purposes.

## 🌟 Features Demonstrated

1. **Data Loading and Exploration**
   - Loading datasets using Spark's DataFrame API.
   - Data cleaning and preprocessing.

2. **Feature Engineering**
   - Transforming and scaling features.
   - Using `VectorAssembler` and other Spark tools.

3. **Model Training**
   - Training ML models using Spark MLlib (e.g., Linear Regression, Random Forest).
   - Cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning.

4. **Model Evaluation**
   - Using metrics such as RMSE, R2, accuracy, etc., to evaluate models.

5. **Prediction**
   - Generating predictions on test datasets.
   - Saving and loading trained models.


## 📑 Requirements

- **Python**: 3.8+
- **PySpark**: 3.x
- **Jupyter Notebook**: Installed via Anaconda or pip.
- **Docker** (Optional): For setting up a PySpark environment. (being used here)
